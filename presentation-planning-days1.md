### Introduction

Running a planning day means taking a whole team off their normal work for a day, it's costly but an effective planing day can be well worth it. Planning days foster team collaboration, bonding, better communication and autonomy, and give the team space to stop just going through the motions but to think ahead about what we're working on and be innovative about how we work on it.

On the 8th June the Redfin team went offsite for a planning day, I'm going to share with you a bit about what we did, and based on the lessons we learnt how you can run a planning day that will super charge your team.

### Agenda

Firstly, set a clear objective for the day. This will help when planning the agenda and set expectations for what we want to achieve. For example, the Redfin planning day objective was to *"To come out with a shared understanding of our product, our client needs and our competitors so we can have a clear technical vision for the year ahead."*. The agenda was built around this, we had product strategy present the roadmap and competitor analysis, we ran games to familiarise ourselves with our client base, and we discussed a technical strategy for our upcoming initiatives.

I take the role of Technical Advisor very literally, I try to promote autonomy by not telling the team what to do but by advising them so they can make their own informed decisions. To that end I didn't want the team to just attend the planning day, I wanted them to be involved in it. Developing the agenda was done in collaboration with the team and with product strategy, and anyone interested was welcome to run a session. 

I wanted to set a flow for the day based on the double diamond design process ()

Here's what we came up with for our agenda. We opened the day with product strategy's vision for the module, including looking at market placement, competitor analysis and win / loss analysis.
