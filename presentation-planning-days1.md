### Introduction

Running a planning day means taking a whole team off their normal work for a day, it's costly but an effective planing day can be well worth it. Planning days foster team collaboration, bonding, better communication and autonomy, and give the team space to stop just going through the motions but to think ahead about what we're working on and be innovative about how we work on it.

On the 8th June the Redfin team went offsite for a planning day, I'm going to share with you a bit about what we did, and based on the lessons we learnt how you can run a planning day that will super charge your team.

### Agenda

Firstly, set a clear objective for the day. This will help when planning the agenda and set expectations for what we want to achieve. For example, the Redfin planning day objective was to *"To come out with a shared understanding of our product, our client needs and our competitors so we can have a clear technical vision for the year ahead."*. The agenda was built around this, we had product strategy present the roadmap and competitor analysis, we ran games to familiarise ourselves with our client base, and we discussed a technical strategy for our upcoming initiatives.

Get the whole team involved in planning the planning day. Make them involved in it rather than just attending it, invite team members to run a session, it's a good professional development opportunity.

Here's our agenda. We opened the day with product strategy's vision for the module, including looking at market placement, competitor analysis and win / loss analysis. 

You can see there's a flow to this agenda, we started with a learning about what our customers want, then Owen presented the initiative roadmap for how we're going to get there, we then focused on a couple of areas of our system we knew we wanted to refine and ran a design jam session to brainstorm different solutions to the problem, all leading up to a deeper discussion in the technical strategy about how we'll deliver on these solutions. 

Allow time during the day for innovation, be explicit about when we're open to crazy ideas and new approaches, but bring those ideas back to reality in some concrete outcomes.

We found it great having Dayne join us for our strategy and design jam sessions, and Tal provided some useful guidance in our technical strategy discussion.
